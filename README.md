# Udacity-Dog-Breed-Recognition-Project
The project is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project.
In this project, we learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
